# League of Legends - High Elo Ranked Games analysis

A descriptive and exploratory analysis carried out on the League of Legends game. The dataset was found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/gyejr95/league-of-legends-challenger-ranked-games2020) on Kaggle. Some of the raised questions:

- Is the team side biased when it comes to wins?
- Does it matter to get focused on the side objectives of the game?
- Are wards life-saving?
- What is the most important thing you need to improve on in order to achieve the victory in Summoner's Rift?
