# Clustering and KMeans Algorithm Implementation

Organizing data into clusters is one of the fundamental ways of understanding and learning. For example, organisms in a biological system are classified into domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping objects according to similar measures or characteristics. Cluster analysis, in essence, does not use category labels that mark objects with previous identifiers, that is, class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes the grouping of data (unsupervised learning) from the discriminating classification or analysis (supervised learning). The objective of clustering is to find structures in data and, therefore, it is exploratory in nature.

This work aims to demonstrate the a step-by-step implementation of the KMeans algorithm, understand what's the point in applying the Elbow Method and to use the final self-made algorithm in a real dataset.
