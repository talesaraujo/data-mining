# Assignment 2

## Data Science Fluxogram
The work of a data scientist can be complex sometimes. And it depends on the execution of several tasks in order to achieve the desired goals. Every starter in the data science field _must_ get to know the workflow process, as it becomes easier to understand its complexity and more likely for the beginner to become a qualified professional. This part of the assignment attempts to describe a guideline to this complex process and describe what could be the pluses and minuses of the data scientist way of life.

## Perceptron Implementation
The basic unit of a neural network - the _perceptron_ - implements the idea of an artificial neuron, a very simple yet ingenuous idea that will be good to prove the basic concepts of a neural network, as well as the training and validation process of a machine learning model. This unit is implemented from scratch and tested out against a known "real" dataset. Cross-validation is implemented as well.
