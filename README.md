# data-mining

This repository was meant to keep all assignment codes and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) worked on the Data Mining Course held on by the Computing Departament of UFC (Federal University of Cear√°), Brazil. This course provided the basic undestanding of data mining and data analysis, as well as machine learning methods, natural language processing and deep learning models in a wide range of topics. You can check the course curriculum [here](https://cc.ufc.br/curso/matriz-curricular/?cod=CK0223) (only available in Portuguese).
The assignments do not cover all contents worked on the course, but only a tiny extent of it.
