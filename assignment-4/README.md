# Fake News Classification

In this exercise we will apply Natural Language Processing methods in order to transform our dataset and be able to classify news whether they are fake or not. We will employ the `countVectorizer` and `tfidfVectorizer` techniques to perform a comparison between both of them. For each one, a model using Multinomial Naive Bayes will determine classification parameters over these two techniques, so as to find the best result, and tell the difference, if there is any.
